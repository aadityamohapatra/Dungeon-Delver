# Dungeon-Delver

Classic game of Dungeon Delver, 
For ITI : Game Design Methodology - Final Project


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unity initially spawns you in this middle of the dungeon sort of cave,the objective here is to kill the skeleton looking enemy (called skeletos), upon which Skeletos on death have a tendency of dropping items. They could drop health orbs, keys or nothing at all. 

Enjoy the game! 

Any feedback is appreciated.
